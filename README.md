# The Stacker Game
This project is an implementation of the game Stacker using the program Ruby2D. 
The game consists of a grid where the player must stack blocks on top of each other. 
The blocks move from one side to the other, and the player must press a key at the right time to place the block on top of the previous one. 
The game ends if the player misses and the block does not end up on top of the previous one.

You are free to explore and modify the code to improve the game or add new features.

Enjoy!
